  "comment": "The following cross sections are for pure higgsino-like pair production. They differ from the fully-degenerate case because here not all of the higgsinos are assumed to have the same mass, but there is a mass splitting between the two lightest neutralinos of dM = m(N2) - m(N1), and the mass of the lighter chargino is half-way in between the two neutralinos. These NLO+NLL cross-sections were computed using Resummino and an envelope of the CTEQ6.6 and MSTW2008nlo90cl PDFs. In addition, a dedicated calculation of the branching ratios (BR) of the into two leptons and the into a lepton and neutrino (including the tau lepton(s) where possible) was done with SUSYHit. In this calculation the decays of N2 into C1+X or N1+photon are not allowed. The values are listed in the TWiki.",
